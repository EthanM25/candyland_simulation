# Candyland Simulation

Created a simulation of Candy Land, that records and graphs some basic metrics, using the given paramerters.

Given Parameters:
Simulation of a game of Candy Land (classic board). Play continues until one of the players wins or the deck of
cards runs out.
Game set up is asssumed as follows (some boards may differ):
There are 126 colored spaces following a repeated six-color pattern of (red, purple, yellow, blue, orange,
green) plus an extra red space at the end.
There are two shortcuts(5-->59 and 34--47)

Three spaces make you lose your turn (48, 86, 121). This means the other player gets to go twice in a row.
There are six special character spaces (total of 133 board spaces).
Character locations are as follows: Plumpy:9, Mr. Mint:18, Mr. Gumdrop:43, Nana Nutbread:75, Princess
Lolly:96, Queen Frostine: 104
There are 72 cards in the deck - 1 for each of the six characters, 9 singles and 2 doubles for each color
Players may be on the same space
